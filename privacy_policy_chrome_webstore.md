## Privacy Policy

Bernd Bindreiter built the Chrome Extension "OCSP Checker" as an Open Source Extension. This SERVICE is provided by Bernd Bindreiter at no cost and is intended for use as is. 

**Information Collection and Use**

The extension does not collect any user data or other information. The extension does not use third party services that may collect information used to identify you. The extension only sends the domain name of the currently visisted website to the Server API. This is done encrypted over HTTPS. The server does not store any information other than what is being sent back to the client (the response including OCSP information and other certificate details). The server does not store any personal information which is theoretically available (IP-Address of the client, User-Agent, etc.)
